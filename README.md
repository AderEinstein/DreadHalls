# DreadHalls

3D Horror game with Unity using an FPS controller in a procedurally generated maze

To add on to the effect of the fog and horror background sounds/music, holes are randomly added to the ground such that the player gets more horrified by unexpectedly tumbling while in search of a Glowing Gem that spawns a new level!
